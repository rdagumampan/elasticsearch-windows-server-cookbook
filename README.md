ElasticSearch-Windows-Server-Cookbook
-----

While there are many documentation and blog entries in setting up an operational ELK clusters, they are mostly annexed to Linux Servers or SaaS-based implementation. The truth is, the are still many software houses ans internal development teams out there have yet to use cloud or have limited competency to manage nix servers. I hope this guide helps get started, improve your team capability and reap the benefits of ES in your tech stack.

This guide documents the step-by-step process we went though in putting up ELK into operational use.

#### Scope of work

- Setup a Windows Server to host ELK
- Configure a C#/.NET application to sink to ES
- Tail your logs with LogTrail
- Configure archiving and index maintenance (WIP)
- Secure your server (WIP)
- Scale out your clusters (WIP)
