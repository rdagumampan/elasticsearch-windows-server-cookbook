ElasticSearch-Windows-Server-Cookbook
-----

While there are many documentation and blog entries in setting up an operational ELK clusters, they are mostly annexed to Linux Servers or SaaS-based implementation. There are still many internal development teams out there who would benefit much on ES capability using existing Windows-based tech infrastrucutre.

As I'm learning ELK and trying to put this into operational use, I am documenting the step-by-step process I went through and I hope this helps you get started.

#### Scope of work

- Setup a Windows Server to host ELK
- Configure a C#/.NET application to sink tin ES
- Tail your logs with LogTrail
- Configure archiving and index maintenance (WIP)
- Secure your server (WIP)
- Scale out your clusters (WIP)
