ElasticSearch-Windows-Server-Cookbook
-----

While there are many documentation and blog entries in setting up an operational ELK clusters, they are mostly annexed to Linux Servers or SaaS-based. But there are still many internal development teams out there who would benefit much on ES capability using existing Windows-based tech infrastrucutre.

As I'm learning ELK and trying to put this into operational use, I am documenting the step-by-step guide. HTH
